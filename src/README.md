Write a program that asks the user for their age using the prompt function. The program should do the following:

If the user enters a value less than 0, output "Error: Invalid age."
If the user enters a value between 0 and 12 (inclusive), output "You are a child."
If the user enters a value between 13 and 19 (inclusive), output "You are a teenager."
If the user enters a value greater than 19, output "You are an adult."





Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive). If the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 10, output the message "Invalid input". If the user enters a number that is either even OR divisible by 3, output the message "Valid input". If the user enters a number that is odd AND not divisible by 3, output the message "Invalid input".
